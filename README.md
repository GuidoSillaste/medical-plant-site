# Medical plants

This website was created to introduce diffrent medical plants that would otherwise be forgoten or missunderstood. It provides a basic intoduction of herbs and a herbalist that describes some of the beneficial effects of medical plants. I divided the medical plants to 3 diffrent categorys where each one gets either harder to find or is suppresesd by bigpharma.

This is the first of five Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during their Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute.

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

The main colours used throughout the website are a mixture of blue and lightbrown, with Red for footer hover.

#### Typography

The pairing of the fonts [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto "Link to Roboto Google Font") and [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato "Link to Lato Google Font") is used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case of import failure.

For features that needed to be highlighted, such as the featured single on the Homepage, the font [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat "Link to Montserrat Google Font") was used, with Sans Serif as the fallback. This was in order to create a consistency with the digital artwork of the single's release.

#### Imagery

For images were specially chosen to fit plants used

The imagery  visually represents the purpose of the website.

All imagery provides alternative text to be used in the event that the element cannot be rendered.
